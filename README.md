# Open Science Workshops
## Reproducible Research Mini-series

> *All the goodness of our wildly popular Carpentries workshops packed into bite-size portions*

The aim of the OSDC Mini-series workshops is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested in working with social sciences data in R.

All OSDC workshops were designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a half-day (2-4 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.
