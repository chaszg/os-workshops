# OSDC MiniSeries: Reproducible Research

> *All the goodness of our wildly popular Carpentries workshops packed into shorter, bite-size portions*

The aim of the OSDC MiniSeries workshops is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. OSDC workshops are designed for participants with no programming experience. 

Each Mini course is designed to last between 2 and 4 hours, which can be completed in one half-day event. This abbreviated format is intended to complement the more intensive 2-3 day format of our [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/) and the 1-hour [Library workshop series](https://cmu.libcal.com/calendar/workshops?cid=9148&t=g&d=0000-00-00&cal=9148&inc=0). Minis provide more modular presentations of the Carpentries curriculum and are therefore ideal for participants with more limited availability.

## Reproducible Research
The theme of this MiniSeries is reproducible research. 

This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.
